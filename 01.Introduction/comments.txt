Companies will use docker for sure so we need to learn it, we cannot skip it.

Docker works in containers, this tehnology came after the cloud tecchnology.
The code runs insade the containers.

Everybody can work with Docker, not just developers.

DOCKER WILL BE USED BY EVERYBODY IN THE FUTURE.
IT'S ABOUT SPEED, IT'S VERY FAST THAT'S WHY EVERIBODY WILL USE IT IN FUTURE.

Develops, builds, tests, deploys, recovers faster.


With the containers it does not matted the operatin system, it runs on all of them
even cloud and mobile apps.


BIG COMPANIES LIKE PayPal AND OTHERS USE DOCKER BECAUSE IT'S EASYER.


They have a personal symbol which is a real life turtle. 
They celebrate every year docker's birthday.

Docker is open source.


---------------------


We will use Docker CE Community Edition that is free.
Docker Enterprise Edition is for big enterprices, it has more features
and it is paid.

On WIndows and Mac Docker runs a virtual machine to run the containers.


--------------------


We have Linux containers and Windows containers, they have small deference.
For windows we will use powershell terminal.


---------------------


When we open the Docker quick start icon, it starts silently a machine on 
VirtualBox AND IT OPENS A TERMINAL WITH WHICH WE CAN CONTROL THE MACHINE IT CREATED.

From there we type deferent commands.

DOCKERS ACTUALLY RUNS INSADE THAT VIRTUAL MACHINE, NOT ON OUR PC.


We will use powershell and vscode

Bind Mounting :
	This just connects source files that we have downloaded on our machine 
	to the docker linux machine.
	
	This can be done with the docker toolbox but we need the files to be
	in our C:/Users/ folder.

	Bind mounting does not work for databases, just for files with code.
